# low_native_api

Support library for native modules for low.js writting in C/C++. These modules can be loaded by low.js programs, allowing the programs to be written in a mixture of JavaScript and C/C++.

## Documentation

The full documentation can be found here:

## Example using a native module:

### ON ESP32 MICROCONTROLLER OR LOW.JS SERVER WITH NEONIOUS IDE

Step 1: Compile the native module:

```
cd example
make clean
make esp32
```

Step 2:

Copy index.js and native.so (compiled in Step 1) to microcontroller
via lowsync or neonious IDE and run!

### ON PC WITH PLAIN LOW.JS

Step 1: Compile the native module:

```
cd example
make clean
make
```

Step 2: Run low.js script:

You can download the `low` binary from https://www.neonious.com/lowjs/downloads.html

```
low index.js
```

To see what is happening, take a look at index.js. It loads native.so which
is compiled from native.cpp by the Makefile.
